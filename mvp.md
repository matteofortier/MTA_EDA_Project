The initial goal of this project was to analyse the relationship between entertainment events hosted at Madison Square Garden and the foot traffic of surrounding subway stations. Preliminary analysis showed surrounding station '34 ST-PENN STA'  was (*very*) busy, everyday, especially during weekdays. Considering the subway station's location and its connection to the LIRR, its busyness makes sense. The analysis on the relationship of subway foot traffic with events at MSG showed little to no relationship at all, potentially indicating how busy '34 ST-PENN STA' truly is. 

Within the context of the project (avoiding crowds, COVID), such findings are not very useful; simply avoid '34 ST-PENN STA' , one of the busiest stations in NYC. Hence, the focus of the project was pivoted towards stations that weren't located in central Manhattan. Specifically '161/YANKEE STAD', next to the Yankee Stadium and home of the Yankees baseball team. Additional data on Yankees games was used to obtain dates of when the Yankees had home games.
