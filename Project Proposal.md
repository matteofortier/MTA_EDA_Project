**Framing Question:** What is the relationship between entertainment events hosted at Madison Square Garden and the foot traffic of surrounding subway stations in 2019?

Further exploratory questions include: What stations are least/most affected (if a relationship exists) by entertainment events? What are the times least/most affected? What is the distance range of effects?

**Purpose and Need:** COVID-19 restrictions are easing, and entertainment events are returning to normal frequencies and capacities. However, the virus may persist for a while longer, and people may still be fearful of gathering in large crowds, especially in poorly ventilated tight places such as a subway. It is valuable to analyse the relationship between entertainment events and the traffic of subways so that those who prefer to avoid large crowds can evaluate whether taking the subway at a station where an event is taking place is appropriate. This especially benefits high-risk individuals where crowds are a crucial consideration. This can also benefit event organisers who want to suggest alternative journeys to customers to maximise sales.

**Data Description:**

The following datasets will be used:

- MTA Turnstile Data - Used to measure the foot traffic of stations at a given day at a given 4 hour interval. Obtained via http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html.
- Past Concerts Archive for MSG - Used to obtain dates of when previous concerts were hosted at MSG. Obtained via https://www.concertarchives.org/venues/madison-square-garden--4?page=1&year=2019#concert-table



What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?

If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

**Tools:**

How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

**MVP Goal:**

What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
